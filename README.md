# Questions-Dreams

This application was created with the objective of implementing a Full Stack Development project from the ground up. 

1. Using MySQL Workbench a database was developed to hold questions from students for the interview process. 
  Each question was given and Id, answer, question and subject columns wish would help track questions based on their id or their           respective subject.

2. Using Springboot a Back end RestAPI was developed to handle request from consumers and be able to handle all CRUD operations on the database. 5 classes were implemented to achieve this simple but effective Rest API

3. Finally a Front End application was made to let the user interact with the data and be able to prepare for upcoming interviews.
